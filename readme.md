# UBC FOOD

## What is this?
The goal of this project is to create a one-stop platform for UBC students and
faculty to access menus and food services information, share feedback, and promote
a healthy and collaborative approach to on-campus dining.

## Logistics and Schedule
Our initial goal will be to create a social app available for iOS
and Android smartphones. The prototype will be be exhibited here, alongside the source code.

## Features List
### Prototype
* Interface allowing user to pick a dining location, which will then open information
about hours, menu etc.
* Query system for fetching information (if api exists) OR
* crowd sourced information and dialogues system

### Long-Term
* Review system for locations and specific food items.
* Behind-the-scenes view for food services to view feedback and other stats

## Running
The currently running version of the app uses the Flutter framework and is written in Dart. To compile and run, configure flutter and an emulator on your machine.
### Additional Dependencies
Google Firebase for data storage (see pubspec)
